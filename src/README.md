====================
#Summary
The tokenizer project aims to implement a program that allows tokenizing text
strings into individual words. The idea is to provide a tool that can separate
a text string into words, removing whitespace and other unwanted characters.

The program could offer a command-line interface where the user inputs a text
string and gets a list of separated words as output. It could also include
additional options, such as handling punctuation or customizing the delimiters
used to separate the words.

## Installation



1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project(src).

3. Compile the program by executing the following command: ./runner

##Usage

Once the program is running, a menu will be displayed with the following
options:



1. Tokenize a word: Enter a word, and the program will tokenize it into
individual words.

2.View history:

  *Print the entire history: Displays all the tokenized words so far.

  *Print specific index: Allows you to enter an index and displays the
    corresponding tokenized word.
    
   *Clear history: Removes all words from the history.

3. Quit: Exits the program.
